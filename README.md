# Cryptography Project: Authentication for Student Qualifications

## Introduction
This project implements an authentication system for student qualifications using the **Falcon Signatures Algorithm**, a post-quantum cryptography method. The system ensures secure verification of academic credentials through cryptographic techniques.

## Components of the Project
1. **Falcon Digital Signature**: Core cryptographic functionality.
2. **Client**: Frontend interface for users.
3. **Database**: Stores qualification data and cryptographic keys.
4. **QR Code Generation**: For secure and easy verification of qualifications.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **FastAPI**: Web framework.
- **SQLite**: Database management.
- **PyCryptodome**: Cryptographic operations.
- **QR Code Library**: For generating scannable codes.

## Achievements
- Developed a secure method for verifying academic qualifications.
- Implemented a post-quantum cryptographic signature (Falcon).
- Enhanced security in credential authentication using QR code integration.
